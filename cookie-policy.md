## Introduction

Our websites, sheetty.com, along with all subdomains under this domain (collectively referred to as “we,” “us,” or
“our”), use cookies and similar technologies to provide the best user experience. This Cookie Policy outlines what
cookies are, how we use them, the types of cookies we employ, and the choices you can make regarding their use.

## What are cookies?

Cookies are small text files stored on your device (computer, tablet, or mobile) when your browser loads a website. They
help the website remember your actions (like login status and selected client) and preferences (such as timeline or
listview for time entries) over time. Some cookies ensure the website functions properly, some provide faster page load
times by caching frequently accessed data, and others help us understand what works well and what needs improvement.

## Other data storage technologies

In addition to cookies, our policy also applies to other similar technologies used for storing information in your
browser. These include, but are not limited to, local storage, session storage, and other data storage technologies.
These technologies function similarly to cookies and are used to enhance your browsing experience by storing information
such as your personal data or preferences.
