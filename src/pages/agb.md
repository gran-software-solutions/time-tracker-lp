# Sheetty Terms of Service

Effective Date: 14.11.2024

## 1. Welcome to GRAN
We’re excited to have you here, and we want to make sure you have a great experience using our Service. 
At GRAN Software Solutions GmbH (**“GRAN”**, **“us”**, **“we”**), our goal is to help you focus on making money by simplifying and
streamlining workflows that any software company has to face every day. To achieve this, it’s important that we set clear
expectations between you, our valued user, and us.

These Terms and Conditions (**"Terms"**) are here to help define our relationship and ensure that both you and we understand
the rules and guidelines when using our Service. This document explains the legal aspects of using Sheetty, including
how you can use our Service, what we are responsible for, and what happens if things go wrong. It’s important that you
take a few minutes to read through these Terms to understand your rights and obligations.

In addition to these Terms, we also have two other documents that are equally important for you to review:
- **<a target="_blank" href="/datenschutz">Privacy Policy</a>**. This outlines how we collect, use, and protect your personal data.
- **<a target="_blank" href="/aup">Acceptable Use Policy</a>**. This details the rules on what is not allowed when using our service.

By using Sheetty or any other of our Services, you are agreeing to follow not just these Terms, but also our Privacy
Policy and Acceptable Use Policy (together, the **“Agreements”**). These Agreements are designed to make sure that everyone 
who uses our Services can do so in a safe, fair, and transparent environment.

Whenever we refer to **“Service”** or **“Services”** in these Terms, we mean our website, platform, and any other features,
software, or services provided by GRAN, including Sheetty. When we say **“You”** or **“User”**, we’re referring to anyone 
who uses our Service.

Lastly, while we’ve done our best to keep things clear and easy to understand, we recognize that legal terms can
sometimes be tricky. If you ever have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to reach out to
us at hello@gransoftware.de.

As our Services evolve, we may need to update these Terms from time to time. We’ll notify you of any significant 
changes via e-mail, so you can stay informed.

## 2. Your account
### You provide complete information

Whenever you need to create an account to use our Services (like for example Sheetty), you agree to provide accurate,
complete, and up-to-date information. This information is necessary for us to provide you with important communications
about your subscription, service updates, and any billing issues. If any of your account information changes,
you are responsible for updating it or informing us about changes at hello@gransoftware.de.

### Keep your credentials safe
You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and all activity that happens under your account.
Please keep your login credentials confidential and secure. If you suspect that someone else is using your account
without your permission, you must notify us immediately at hello@gransoftware.de. We are not liable for any loss or
damage arising from unauthorized use of your account.

### You must be at least 18
You must be at least 18 to create and maintain an account with us. By creating an account, you confirm that you meet 
this eligibility requirement. If you are creating an account on behalf of a business or other entity, you confirm 
that you are authorized to do so.

### You agree not to
- Share your account with anyone else.
- Transfer your account to another person or entity without our written permission.
- Create multiple accounts for yourself or your business, unless explicitly permitted.
- Use the account in violation of our Acceptable Use Policy.

### Termination and Suspension
We reserve the right to suspend, restrict, or terminate your account at any time, with or without notice, if:

- You breach any of the Agreements.
- We detect any suspicious activity, unauthorized use, or misuse of your account.
- We determine it’s necessary to protect the integrity of our Services or comply with legal obligations.

If you choose to terminate your account, you can do so by contacting us at hello@gransoftware.de. Upon termination,
we may delete your data, unless otherwise required to retain it by law or our legitimate interests.

## 3. Your content
### Your Content belongs to you
While using our services you will provide us stuff like notes, entries, contracts or contacts (**“Your Content”**).
You are responsible for Your Content. These Terms don’t grant us any rights to Your Content except for limited
rights necessary to provide you our Services. We do our best to keep Your Content safe and secure.

You give us permission to store, back up, and process Your Content to make Services work as expected. This includes
using it to improve our features, but it does not grant us ownership of Your Content.

### You are responsible for Your Content
You’re responsible for ensuring that Your Content is lawful, appropriate, and in compliance with these Terms. 
We don’t review all content, but if we find content that violates our Terms or the law, we may remove it.

You agree not to upload any content that’s illegal, harmful, abusive, or that violates others' intellectual
property rights. In case of violation, we may suspend or terminate your account, without a refund.

You retain full ownership of Your Content. We don't claim any ownership rights, and you’re free to use it
as you wish outside of our services.

### Data loss is not impossible
We work hard to protect Your Content and keep it secure, but we can’t guarantee complete security.
We recommend you keep a backup of Your Content outside of Services. We are not liable for any loss or damages
resulting from the use of Your Content or unauthorized access to it. You use Services at your own risk.

## 4. Our services
### What We Offer
Our Service is designed to help software agencies focus on billed work. By using our productivity tools, you’ll save
time on essential but often unpaid tasks like tracking hours, managing contracts, and generating timesheets. We’re here
to make your workday easier and more efficient.

### Here’s what you can expect
- Time Tracking to help you stay on top of your hours and projects.
- Contract Management to keep those important numbers and dates organized.
- Timesheets for a clear record of the work you’re putting in.

Currently, our Services are available in the EU. We may expand to other regions in the future and will keep you
posted on any updates.
 
### Service Availability & Modifications
We do our best to keep everything up and running smoothly. However, sometimes things don’t go as planned—like
scheduled maintenance or occasional technical hiccups. Here’s what you need to know:

#### Availability
We aim to keep our service running 24/7, but we can’t guarantee uninterrupted access. We’re not liable for any 
downtime, interruptions, or service disruptions, whether planned or unexpected. If there’s any prolonged disruption,
we’ll keep you informed whenever possible.

#### Updates & Changes
Our team is always working to improve your experience. We may add, modify, or remove features from time to time,
sometimes without prior notice. While we’ll try to keep you informed of any major changes, some adjustments may
happen on the fly to enhance your experience.

#### Quality
We work hard to deliver a high-quality experience, but please note that we can’t guarantee flawless performance. 
Our goal is to provide reliable tools, though occasional bugs or technical issues may arise. If you encounter any
problems, reach out to us at hello@gransoftware.de, and we’ll do our best to help.

### Feedback
We value your input! If you have suggestions on how we can improve our Service, we’d love to hear them at 
hello@gransoftware.de or using any contact form of ours. Please remember, though, that any feedback you provide
may be used by us to enhance the platform—no strings attached.

## 5. Payment and billing
### Auto-renewal
By signing up for a subscription, you agree to pay the applicable fees according to your chosen plan. Subscriptions 
are billed in advance on a monthly or annual basis and automatically renew at the end of each billing period unless
cancelled through your account settings. By subscribing, you authorize us to charge your selected payment method for
recurring fees until you cancel.
### No refunds
All payments are non-refundable. If you cancel your subscription, it will remain active until the end of the current
billing period, after which it will not renew.
### Price may change
If we change our pricing, we will provide advance notice so you can decide whether to continue your subscription.
For any billing disputes, please contact us within 14 days of the charge. Chargebacks without prior contact may 
result in the suspension of your account.
### Taxes and fees
You are responsible for any applicable taxes, duties, or fees imposed by your local jurisdiction. If payment is not 
completed on time, your subscription may be suspended until outstanding charges are paid.
### Our payment provider
We use a third-party payment provider, Stripe, to securely process payments. By providing your payment information,
you authorize us to share relevant billing and payment details with Stripe solely for transaction processing. 
<a href="https://stripe.com/en-de/legal/ssa" target="_blank">Stripe’s Terms of Service</a> govern their handling of your information. We are not responsible for errors or issues 
that arise from third-party payment processing.

## 6. Termination

### When can we terminate
We may need to end your access if certain issues come up, like a violation of the Agreements or misuse of the Service. 
But don’t worry—we’ll make every effort to reach out and give you a heads-up before any termination happens. However, if the safety of other users or the integrity of our Services is at risk, we may end your account immediately without notice.

### When can you terminate
You can cancel your account anytime. Just let us know at hello@gransoftware.de. If you’re on a paid plan, your account 
will stay active until the end of the current billing period, and then we’ll stop billing you.

### What happens after termination
When your account is closed, you’ll no longer have access to the Service or any data stored within your account. If you
need to export your data, just let us know at hello@gransoftware.de within two weeks of termination, and we’ll provide 
it to you. If you decide to come back, feel free to re-subscribe again at any time.

### What happens to your data after termination
We know your data is important. After termination, we’ll do our best to keep it on file for 30 days to give you time to
download anything you might need. After that, we may delete it from our servers, unless legally required to retain
it longer.

Please be aware that while we aim to keep your data available for 30 days post-termination, data retrieval cannot be
guaranteed and is provided on a best-effort basis. We recommend exporting important data before cancelling your account
whenever possible.

### Notice periods and communication
If we need to end your account, we’ll notify you at least 7 days in advance via email. However, if the safety of other
users or the integrity of our Services is at risk, we may end your account immediately without notice. If you decide
to cancel, we’d appreciate a quick message to help us better understand your needs and expectations.

### Limited liability upon termination
Our goal is always to serve you as best we can, but if we have to end your access to our Service, we cannot be held 
liable for any losses or damages of any kind. Termination is at our sole discretion if we believe there’s been a
violation of these terms or other Agreements, misuse of the Service, or if required by law. By using our Service, 
you agree that termination doesn’t make us liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or 
punitive damages, nor any claims arising from your use of the Service.

## 7. Privacy and data protection
Your privacy and data security are our top priorities. We follow these principles to keep your data safe and
comply with GDPR:

- We only collect the information we need to provide and improve our service.
- We encrypt your data in transit and at rest, ensuring it’s secure throughout its journey.
- We carefully select partners who meet GDPR standards and adhere to strict data protection guidelines.
- You have complete control over your data, with the ability to access, update, or delete it whenever you choose.
- We use secure authentication methods instead of passwords, reducing the risk of credential theft.

We also use cookies and similar technologies to deliver our services. Some are essential, while others help us
improve your experience. You can manage these preferences through your browser or in our settings.

For more information on how we handle your data, please review our Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy.

You may also want to review the privacy policies of our partners:
- https://stripe.com/privacy
- https://policies.google.com/privacy
- https://contabo.com/en/legal/privacy/
- https://www.hetzner.com/legal/privacy-policy/

While we take every reasonable measure to protect your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security due to the nature 
of the internet and digital systems.

## 8. Intellectual property (**“IP”**)
### Ownership of Our Service

Our Services, including all software, content, and designs, are our property. By using the Service, we grant you a 
limited, non-exclusive, and non-transferable license to use it for its intended purpose, but you do not gain any
ownership of this content.

This means that you are not the only one with this license to use our Services, and you cannot transfer or assign 
this license to anyone else.

Using our Services does not transfer any of our intellectual property rights to you, other than the specific license
outlined in this agreement. This includes any content or technology displayed or accessed within our platform.

### Your Content
You own Your Content (e.g. what you create, upload, or otherwise add to our Services). By adding Your Content, you 
give us a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, display, and process it as necessary 
to run and improve our Services. Read more about it in section 3.

You are solely responsible for ensuring you have the necessary rights to upload or share any content within our 
Services. We cannot be held responsible for content that infringes third-party IP rights or violates governing laws.
If such content is found, we reserve the right to remove it promptly.

### Using Our Intellectual Property
Don’t use our Services in ways that weren’t intended, such as by copying, distributing, or reverse-engineering it. 
You cannot scrape, resell or use our Services in a way that violates laws or infringe any intellectual property rights.
Please, just stick to its intended use.

### Reporting Concerns
If you believe any content on our platform infringes your copyright, please contact us at hello@gransoftware.de with
details of the alleged infringement. We follow the EU Copyright Directive’s “Notice-and-Takedown” procedures and will
review and, if necessary, remove any infringing content.

If you believe someone is violating our IP or using it improperly, please let us know at hello@gransoftware.de. We take
these matters seriously and will take appropriate action.

### Reservation of Rights
We’re granting you a license to use our Services, but we’re not giving up any of our rights. Any rights not explicitly 
granted here remain ours.

## 9. Limitation of liability
WE DON’T EXCLUDE OR LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU WHERE IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL TO DO SO—THIS INCLUDES ANY LIABILITY FOR GRAN
OR OUR AFFILIATES' FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION IN PROVIDING THE SERVICES. IN REGIONS WHERE CERTAIN TYPES OF 
LIABILITY EXCLUSIONS AREN’T ALLOWED, WE’RE RESPONSIBLE TO YOU ONLY FOR LOSSES AND DAMAGES THAT ARE A REASONABLY 
FORESEEABLE RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO USE REASONABLE CARE AND SKILL OR OUR BREACH OF CONTRACT WITH YOU. THIS SECTION
DOES NOT AFFECT YOUR STATUTORY CONSUMER RIGHTS THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED OR LIMITED BY ANY AGREEMENT.

IN COUNTRIES WHERE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ARE ALLOWED, GRAN, ALONG WITH ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, 
OR DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR:

- ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR
- ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL THEORY USED.

THESE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT GRAN OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES HAS BEEN ADVISED
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

IF YOU USE THE SERVICE FOR COMMERCIAL OR BUSINESS PURPOSES, GRAN AND ITS AFFILIATES WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR 
ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, LOSS OF BUSINESS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY.

OTHER THAN FOR TYPES OF LIABILITY THAT WE CANNOT LIMIT BY LAW (AS DESCRIBED ABOVE), GRAN LIMITS OUR LIABILITY TO YOU
TO 100% OF ANY AMOUNT YOU’VE PAID TO GRAN UNDER YOUR CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION OR SERVICE PLAN. THIS PROVISION DOES NOT
APPLY WHERE PROHIBITED BY EU OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW.

## 10. Modifications
We’re constantly working to improve our Services, so we may update or change these Terms from time to time. 
This could include changes to the Services themselves, features, functionality, pricing, or how we deliver our services.

If we make any significant changes to these Terms, we’ll notify you by email, and the updated version will be
posted on our website. We encourage you to review the Terms periodically to stay informed about any changes.

By continuing to use our Service after the changes take effect, you agree to the updated Terms. If you do not
agree with the changes, you can stop using the Service at any time.

Changes will take effect as soon as they are posted, unless we specify otherwise.

## 11. Governing law
These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Germany, without regard to its conflict of 
law principles.

Any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms, your use of the Service, or any other matter related to our
relationship shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Berlin, Germany.
