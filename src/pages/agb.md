# Terms of Service

Effective Date: 04.01.2024

Welcome to GRAN!

If you have any questions regarding the GRAN Terms of Service, please email us at hello@gransoftware.de

This GRAN Terms of Service (“Agreement”) is entered into by and between the GRAN Software Solutions GmbH (“GRAN”)
entity (a german corporation with offices in Berlin, Germany) and the person or entity you represent (“Customer”, “you”
and “your”). If you are accessing or using the Services on behalf of your company, you confirm that you are authorised
to accept this Agreement on behalf of your company, and all references to “you”, “your” or “Customer” reference your
company. More of the definitions are listed under the Definitions section of this document.

This Agreement allows the Customer to acquire subscriptions for online software-as-a-service products and other services
from GRAN in accordance with any GRAN ordering documents, online registration, order descriptions, or order
confirmations that make reference to this Agreement ("Order Forms"). It outlines the fundamental terms and conditions
governing the delivery of those products and services. The terms of this Agreement apply to the Customer's initial
purchase on the Effective Date, as well as any subsequent purchases made by the Customer that explicitly refer to this
Agreement.

## Introduction

### 1.1 Overview of the Services

GRAN’s Services are a set of applications including, but not limited to, time tracking and timesheet export.

### Trial Subscription

If the Customer is provided with complimentary access, a trial, or an evaluation subscription to the Service (
referred
to as a "Trial Subscription"), the Customer may use the Services in accordance with the terms and conditions outlined
in
this Agreement for a duration of ninety (90) days or any other period approved by GRAN (referred to as the "Trial
Period"). Trial Subscriptions are authorised exclusively for the Customer's assessment to determine whether to
procure a
paid subscription to the Services. In the event that the Customer does not proceed to a paid Subscription Term, this
Agreement and the Customer's entitlement to access and use the Services will end at the conclusion of the Trial
Period.
GRAN reserves the right to terminate a Trial Subscription at its discretion and without cause. Regardless of any
provisions to the contrary in this Agreement, GRAN assumes no warranty, indemnity, support, or other obligations
concerning Trial Subscriptions.

If the purchase is made during the Trial Period, its reminder will be carried to the purchased Subscription Term
without
incurring any additional costs. For example, if the customer purchases the 30-day Premium Subscription while still
having 10 days remaining in the trial period, the total Subscription Term will be extended to 40 days.

### 1.3 Teams Subscription

The Customer may gain access to the Services without starting a Trial Subscription by accepting an invite to an
Organisation. While in Teams Subscription, the Customer cannot manage own clients nor track time for them.

While in Teams Subscription, the Customer can only track time for Organisations they are part of.

Some of the User Data created in Teams Subscription will be shared with other User Accounts: the owner of the
Organisation and other dedicated User Accounts of the Organisation.

The shared User Data includes, but it's not limited to, name, email and tracked time entries, and their descriptions.
This sharing is intended to facilitate building reports, exporting timesheets, and serving any other business
purposes
for the Organization.

The User Data shared with the Organisation will be retained even after the Customer deletes their User Account,
unless
the Organisation's owner deletes their User Account.

### 1.4 Acceptance of Terms

This Agreement is effective upon the date you first access or use the Services (“Effective Date”) and continues
until you or GRAN terminates it (this period, the “Subscription Term”).

By expressing your acceptance of this agreement or by accessing and using any services, you are consenting to abide
by all the terms, conditions, and notices set forth or referenced in this agreement. If you do not agree to this
agreement, please do not use any Services.

This agreement contains mandatory arbitration provisions. Any dispute between you and GRAN must be resolved by
arbitration, rather than jury trials. Please read the arbitration provision in this Agreement as it affects your rights
under this Agreement.

### 1.5 Modifications to this Agreement

We may change this Agreement from time to time. We will notify you of any material change via email, on our website by
providing a link to the revised Agreement, or by other methods we may determine from time to time. Unless otherwise
specified by GRAN, changes become effective for Customer upon renewal of Customer’s current Subscription Term.

You will be prompted to accept or reject any material change to this Agreement the next time you use the Service after
we have made the change. Your acceptance of the revised terms and conditions along with the continued use of the
Services will indicate your consent to be bound by the revised Agreement.

If GRAN specifies that changes to the Agreement will take effect prior to Customer’s next renewal of the Subscription
Term and Customer objects to such changes, Customer may terminate the applicable Subscription Term and receive as its
sole remedy a refund of any fees Customer has pre-paid for use of the applicable Services for the terminated portion of
the Subscription Term.

## 2 User Accounts

### 2.1 Registration

(a) You and your Users must be at least 18 years old and capable of forming a legally binding agreement to register for
an account. (b) You will provide accurate and complete information during the registration process, including a valid
email address and any other required details. (c) Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their
account credentials. They must not share their password or permit anyone else to access their account. (d) Each Account
is intended for individual use only. Users may not create multiple Accounts without explicit permission from the service
provider.

### 2.2 General Restrictions

#### 2.2.1 General Restrictions

The Customer shall not act against AUP, nor allow any third party to do so.

#### 2.2.1 Indemnification by Customer

The Customer agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold GRAN, its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors,
employees, and agents harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with (i) the Customer's use of the
Services, (ii) violation of this Agreement or any applicable Laws, (iii) infringement of any intellectual property,
publicity, privacy, or other rights, (iv) any Customer Data or content submitted to the Services, (v) the Customer's
breach of any representations, warranties, or obligations under this Agreement.

### 2.3 Security

GRAN commits to employing commercially reasonable technical and organisational measures to prevent unauthorised access,
alteration, or disclosure of any Service or Customer Data. Nevertheless, GRAN assumes no responsibility for errors in
transmission, unauthorised third-party access, or other causes beyond GRAN’s control.

## 3 Subscription Term, Fees and Payment

### 3.1 Pricing

The pricing details, including any applicable subscription fees, will be as specified in the Order Form agreed upon by
the Customer. The rates specified in the Order Form are applicable for the initial Subscription Term, and subsequent
adjustments or increases may be automatically applied. Customers will receive prior notification through email, the GRAN
website, or any available communication medium. Unless expressly stated otherwise, all fees are exclusive of any
applicable taxes. The Customer is responsible for settling all Taxes, as detailed in Section 3.2 of this agreement.

The Customer may use Coupons during purchases, and GRAN reserves the right to apply discounts or other benefits at its
discretion.

### 3.2 Billing and Payment

The Customer is required to settle all fees as specified in the relevant Order Form and make payment within thirty (30)
days of receiving the invoice, unless otherwise specified in the applicable Order Form. The Customer is accountable for
settling all Taxes, and unless specified otherwise, Taxes are not included in the fees outlined in the relevant Order
Form. If, due to legal obligations, the Customer must withhold any Taxes from their payment, the payable fees will be
adjusted so that GRAN receives an amount, post-withholding, equivalent to what it would have received without any
withholdings, thereby absolving GRAN from any Tax liability. In the case of delayed payments, a service charge of 0.5%
per month of the amount due or the maximum amount permitted by law, whichever is less, will be applied.

### 3.3 Subscription Term Renewal and Cancellation

#### 3.3.1 Effective Date

This Agreement becomes effective on the Effective Date and remains in force until the expiration or termination of all
Subscription Terms.

#### 3.3.2 Renewal

Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the relevant Order Form, each Subscription Term will renew automatically for
additional periods (as determined by the Customer) unless either party provides written notice of termination through
email.

#### 3.3.3 Cancellation

Either party has the right to terminate this Agreement, including all associated Order Forms, under the following
conditions: (a) failure to remedy any significant breach of this Agreement (including non-payment of fees) within
thirty (30) days after receiving written notice; (b) discontinuation of operations without a successor; or (c)
initiation of bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors' arrangement, composition, or a similar proceeding, or if
such a proceeding is filed against that party and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter.

#### 3.3.4 Refund Policy

With the exception of the provisions explicitly outlined in Section 5.1 (“Limited Warranty”), all fees are
non-refundable, unless expressly stated otherwise in the applicable Order Form. In exceptional cases where GRAN fails to
provide the agreed-upon services or experiences substantial service disruptions, a refund may be considered at GRAN’s
discretion. If a refund is approved, GRAN will process the refund within a reasonable period using the original method
of payment, unless an alternative arrangement is agreed upon.

#### 3.3.5 Survival

The following Sections will survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1.2 (Trial Subscription), 2.2 (
General Restrictions), 2.3 (Security), 4 (Intellectual Property), 5.2 (Warranty Disclaimer), 7 (General Terms).

## 4 Intellectual Property

### 4.1 Ownership of Service

GRAN and its suppliers retain full ownership of all intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights,
trademarks, trade secrets, and other proprietary rights, related to the Services, Documentation, and any derivative
works or improvements (collectively referred to as "GRAN Technology"). The Customer is granted a limited, non-exclusive,
non-transferable licence to use the GRAN Technology solely for the purpose of accessing and using the Services in
accordance with this Agreement. The Services are provided as an online, hosted solution, and the Customer is not
entitled to receive a physical or downloadable copy of the Services or any underlying GRAN Technology. Any trademarks,
service marks, and logos used in connection with the Services are the property of GRAN or its licensors. No licence or
right to use such trademarks is granted to the Customer.

### 4.2 Feedback

Any feedback, suggestions, or contributions provided by the Customer concerning the Services may be used by GRAN to
enhance or improve the GRAN Technology without any obligation or compensation to the Customer.

### 4.3 User Data Ownership

Customer maintains all rights, title, and interest, including intellectual property rights, in the Customer Data
provided to GRAN. Under the terms of this Agreement, Customer grants GRAN a non-exclusive, global, royalty-free right to
use, copy, store, transmit, modify, create derivative works, and display the Customer Data solely to the extent
necessary for providing the Services to Customer. GRAN does not function as an archiving service. While GRAN commits not
to intentionally delete any Customer Data from any Service before the termination of the applicable Subscription Term,
it explicitly disclaims any additional obligations related to storage. The Customer further assures compliance of all
Customer Data with the AUP.

## 5 Limited Warranty

### 5.1 Limited Warranty

GRAN provides a warranty, solely for the benefit of the Customer, ensuring that each Service will function substantially
in accordance with the relevant Documentation. In the event of a breach of this warranty, GRAN's sole liability, and the
Customer's exclusive remedy, will be, at no cost to the Customer, for GRAN to exert commercially reasonable efforts to
correct the reported non-conformity. If GRAN deems such remedy impracticable, either party may terminate the applicable
Subscription Term, and the Customer will receive a refund of any pre-paid fees for the terminated portion of the
Subscription Term. This limited warranty does not apply: (i) unless the Customer submits a claim within thirty (30) days
of discovering the non-conformity, (ii) if the error results from misuse, unauthorised modifications, or third-party
hardware, software, or services, or (iii) to services provided on a no-charge, trial, or evaluation basis.

### 5.2 Warranty Disclaimer

With the exception of the limited warranty outlined in Section 5.1, all Services are provided "as is." Neither GRAN nor
its suppliers make any other warranties, whether express or implied, statutory, or otherwise, including but not limited
to warranties of merchantability, title, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. GRAN does not guarantee
uninterrupted or error-free use of the Services, nor does it warrant the review of Customer Data for accuracy or the
preservation or maintenance of Customer Data without loss or corruption. GRAN is not liable for delays, interruptions,
service failures, or other issues inherent in the use of the internet, third-party platforms, or other systems beyond
GRAN's reasonable control. While the Customer may have other statutory rights, the duration of statutorily required
warranties, if any, shall be limited to the shortest period permitted by law.

## 6 Marketing

The Customer commits to take part in additional reasonable marketing initiatives aimed at highlighting the advantages of
the services for potential customers. This includes allowing GRAN to showcase the Customer's name, profile picture and
logo on GRAN's website and in promotional materials. The Customer acknowledges and agrees that GRAN has the right to
publicly identify them as a customer of GRAN.

## 7 General Terms

### 7.1 Direct Dispute Resolution

(a) In the event of any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with this agreement, the affected party shall
provide written notice to the other party, setting forth the details of the dispute (“Notice of Dispute”). Both parties
agree to engage in good faith negotiations to amicably resolve the dispute before pursuing formal dispute resolution
methods.

(b) If the dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation, the parties agree to submit the dispute to binding
arbitration at Bezirksamt Mitte in Berlin, Germany. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of
Berliner Schiedsamtsgesetz, with the seat of arbitration being Bezirksamt Mitte.

(c) The costs and fees associated with the arbitration process shall be borne by the prevailing party, as determined by
the arbitrator, unless otherwise agreed by the parties.

(d) By agreeing to arbitrate, the parties expressly waive their right to a jury trial.

(e) This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Germany. Any legal action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this agreement shall be brought exclusively in the courts of Bezirksamt Mitte,
Berlin, Germany

(f) For any claim not covered by this dispute resolution provision, the customer agrees to submit to the personal and
exclusive jurisdiction, as well as the exclusive venue, of the commercial courts situated in Berlin, Germany. In any
such dispute, German law shall be applicable.

### 7.2 Force Majeure

Neither party shall be held liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement (excluding
payment obligations) if such delay or failure is caused by unforeseen events occurring after the signing of this
Agreement, and beyond the reasonable control of the affected party. Such events may include, but are not limited to,
strikes, blockades, war, acts of terrorism, riots, natural disasters, failure or diminishment of power,
telecommunications or data networks or services, or the refusal of a licence by a government agency.

### 7.3 Subpoenas

You acknowledge and agree that GRAN may be required to disclose Customer Data in response to a subpoena, court order, or
other legal process. In such cases, GRAN will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the request before complying
unless legally prohibited. By using our services, you consent to the disclosure of Customer Data as described in this
section. You understand and agree that GRAN may disclose Customer Data to law enforcement agencies, government
officials, or third parties as required by law and without your consent. GRAN shall not be liable for any damages or
harm arising from our compliance with legal requests for Customer Data.

### 7.4 Amendments and Waivers

Any changes or additions to this Agreement will only be valid if made in writing and executed by a duly authorised
representative from each party. Conduct or the failure to enforce rights under this Agreement will not imply a waiver,
and no waiver will be effective unless it is in writing and signed by a duly authorised representative of the party
claiming to have waived. No provision in any purchase order or other business form used by the Customer will override
the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Such documents related to this Agreement are solely for administrative
purposes and carry no legal weight.

### 7.5 Severability

If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the provisions herein. In such a case, the parties agree to
replace the invalid or unenforceable provision with a valid and enforceable provision that most closely achieves the
intended economic effect and purpose of the original provision. The invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability of one
provision shall not affect the validity, legality, or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement. All other
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
